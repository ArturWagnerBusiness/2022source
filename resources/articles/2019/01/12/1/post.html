        <p class="title">I may I have not been active lately however I am back with yet another project!</p>
        <p>The project I decided to undertake now is a Windows Command Prompt based Text Editor.<br />For now I was only able to add read and create function to the program. Soon a Save function will be added that will allow the program to be used in a real life scenario. I believe that extensions that I am planning on adding will enchance the software so it will increate in value. Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/ArturWBusiness/CMD/blob/master/editor/main.py">my repository</a>.<br />P.S: Still don't have a spell checker on this webpage creator so spelling mistakes might happen from time to time.</p>

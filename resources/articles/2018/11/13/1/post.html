        <p class="title">Html post writing is now the past</p>
        <p>I was able to make the Tkinter Python interface that allows me to write the posts with ease! This is also where this post was written! I know that this will not bring much of a change to the site but I will be able to create posts in a matter of seconds. Also allowing me to use less of my brain while writing them as I no longer need to add the paths and make sure of the syntax.</p>
        <p>For now that is everything I wanted to mension so now I am just going to go back to Java applets. I really want to get a Java applet up and running on the site. See you all soon!</p>

        <p class="title">Had some time to work on Python!</p>
        <p>For sometime now I started developing a module for an Application. Not sure of the Applications use but I am trying to implement as many feautures as possible. For example now I added a proper *args and *kwargs reading.</p>
        <p>I was also taking some of my time to make some Python lessons for users to take. This is still mainly work in progress, however you may expect more updates on it soon!</p>
        <p class="title">Also I know that not much was added so there you go:</p>

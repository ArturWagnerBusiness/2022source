                  Place where I was given opportunities to work in agile teams.
                  During the <em>second year</em> I was placed in pre-determined
                  teams to create a fully working site for "cheese enthusiasts".
                  Using html/css/js for front-end and php/mysql for back-end.

                  Finally being given an opportunity to create a final year
                  project where I was able to create an website that would
                  integrate university's systems to give students the
                  possibility to improve their learning.

                  During Sixth form I have made a lot of small applications in
                  python which was also my first language. I even used it to
                  automate development on my final project website to automate
                  generation on several html pages. Lot of these small projects
                  can be found{" "}
